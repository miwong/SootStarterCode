# Starter code for Soot Android analysis

This provides a very basic template to analyze an Android APK with Soot.  The APK file should be passed in as the first command line argument.

To build the program, a Gradle script is provided:

    ./gradlew build
  
You can also use Gradle to run the program.  A helper script is provided to help pass in command line arguments to `./gradlew run`:

    ./RunSootTutorial <APK file>
